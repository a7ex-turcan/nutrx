# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Nutrx** is a native iOS/iPadOS SwiftUI application. Bundle ID: `nutrx-labs.nutrx`.

- **Language**: Swift 5.0
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI
- **iOS Deployment Target**: 26.0
- **Built with**: Xcode 26.3

## Build & Run

Open in Xcode:
```bash
open nutrx.xcodeproj
```

Build from command line (skip signing for CLI-only builds):
```bash
xcodebuild -scheme nutrx -configuration Debug -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' build CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=- CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

Run tests:
```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme nutrx -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'
```

## Swift Configuration

Notable build settings in the Xcode project:
- `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor` — All types default to `@MainActor`
- `SWIFT_APPROACHABLE_CONCURRENCY = YES` — Strict concurrency checking enabled
- SwiftUI previews enabled (`ENABLE_PREVIEWS = YES`)
- Xcode project uses `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup` — new files added to the `nutrx/` directory are auto-discovered by Xcode (no manual pbxproj edits needed)

## What is this app?

nutrx is a privacy-first iOS app for tracking daily nutrient intake.
It is intentionally simple, flexible, and fully offline — no accounts, no servers, no ads.
A Pro plan is planned for the future but will only gate AI-powered extras;
all core tracking features remain free forever.

---

## Core Philosophy

- **Private by design** – all data lives exclusively on the user's device (SwiftData). Nothing is ever sent to an external server. There is no backend, no analytics, no telemetry.
- **User-defined everything** – there is no hardcoded list of nutrients. Users define exactly what they want to track, how it's measured, and in what increments.
- **Zero friction daily use** – logging an intake should take seconds. The UI must prioritise speed and clarity over feature density.
- **Apple-native feel** – follow Apple HIG throughout. Use SF Symbols, system fonts, and native components. Aim for an app that feels like it could ship with iOS.

---

## Platform & Tech Stack

- **Platform:** iOS (native Swift / SwiftUI)
- **Persistence:** SwiftData with CloudKit sync (iCloud.nutrx-labs.nutrx)
- **Networking:** None — the app is fully offline (CloudKit sync is transparent/additive)
- **Minimum iOS target:** Latest stable iOS (always target the most recent release)
- **Bundle ID convention:** nutrx-labs.nutrx

---

## App Structure – Tab Navigation

The app has three tabs (defined in `App/MainTabView.swift`):

| Tab | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Today** | The main daily tracking screen |
| **My Nutrients** | Create, edit, delete, and reorder custom nutrients |
| **History** | Browse past daily intake logs |

Profile, Settings, and About are **not** tabs — they're accessed via a profile icon (top-right of every screen's navigation bar). Tapping it opens a flyout menu with three items: "Edit Profile" (opens a sheet), "Settings" (opens a sheet), and "Log Out". About has been moved inside the Settings sheet. This is implemented via the `.withProfileMenu()` view modifier, which every tab applies.

---

## Project Directory Structure

The Xcode project is named `nutrx`. All Swift source lives under `nutrx/`. The structure mirrors the three-tab feature split plus shared infrastructure.

### Rules Claude Code must follow for file placement

- **New SwiftData models** → `Models/`
- **New tab** → new folder under `Features/` with its own `Views/` and `ViewModels/` subfolders
- **New view used in only one feature** → inside that feature's `Views/` folder
- **New view used across two or more features** → `Shared/Components/`
- **Date / number / string utilities** → `Shared/Extensions/`
- **No files at the root of `Features/`** — everything must be inside a named feature folder
- **No business logic in view files** — if a view needs to do anything beyond layout and user input forwarding, that logic belongs in the corresponding ViewModel

---

## Onboarding

Mandatory on first launch. Two-step flow:

1. **Personal Info** — name, birthday, weight (kg/lbs), height (cm/ft) on a single screen
2. **First Nutrient** — create at least one nutrient so the Today screen is never empty

Completion tracked via `UserProfile.onboardingCompleted`. On a new device with iCloud data, onboarding is skipped if a completed profile syncs within 3 seconds.

---

## Nutrient Configuration

Users create and manage their own nutrients. No preset list — fully user-defined. Each nutrient has: **name**, **unit**, **step** (increment per +/− tap), **daily target**, and optional **notes**. Nutrients can be reordered via drag-and-drop. Order in My Nutrients = order on Today screen.

Each nutrient supports zero or more **dose reminders** — times of day that fire local notifications. Smart suppression cancels upcoming reminders after logging intake. Reminders can be configured both during nutrient creation (inline in the form) and via the "Reminders" section in the Edit Nutrient form. Notification permission is requested on first reminder add if not yet granted.

---

## Today Tab – Core Logging UX

The central feature. Each nutrient row shows: name, unit, progress bar, −/+ buttons. Haptic feedback on tap.

- **Swipe right** → Add Exact Amount sheet
- **Swipe left** → Edit Nutrient sheet
- **Long press** → context menu: Edit step amount, Enter custom amount, Exclude for today, Move to Group

Progress bar: blue (in progress), green (at/above target), orange (exceeded). Exceeding a target is allowed.

Intake is computed by summing `IntakeRecord` rows for today's calendar day. No explicit midnight reset needed.

### Expandable Nutrient Cards

Tap any nutrient card to expand a chronological breakdown of all `IntakeRecord` entries for that nutrient today. Each row shows time, signed amount (decrements in orange), and optional note inline. A centered + button at the bottom opens the exact amount sheet. Multiple cards can be open simultaneously. State is transient (`expandedNutrientIDs: Set<UUID>` in `TodayView`) — resets on tab switch. `ExpandableNutrientCard` wraps `NutrientRowView` and owns the card background/clip. `NutrientIntakeHistoryView` fetches records via `@Query`.

---

## History Tab

Chronological list of past days (most recent first), grouped by month. Read-only. Streak summary card at the top shows current and best streak when enabled.

---

## Notifications

All local — no push infrastructure. Two notification types:

1. **Daily check-in reminder** — fires at noon if no intake logged. Opt-in via Settings. Smart one-shot scheduling refreshed on foreground and after every intake action. ID: `daily-checkin-reminder`.
2. **Per-nutrient dose reminders** — configurable times per nutrient. Smart suppression after logging. IDs: `nutrient-{id}-reminder-{HHmm}`.

Permission flow handles not-asked, granted, and denied states. A one-time notification banner appears on Today after onboarding.

**Reinstall/new-device safety:** iOS resets notification permission on app delete, but CloudKit may sync stale `dailyReminderEnabled` and `hasSeenNotificationBanner` flags. On appear, both TodayView and NotificationsSettingsView check the actual iOS permission status — if `notDetermined`, they reset the synced flags so the banner reappears and the toggle reflects reality.

---

## Nutrient Grouping

Nutrients are organised into named groups. Collapsible sections on Today and My Nutrients screens with completion counts and aggregate progress bars.

- **General group** — system group (`isSystem = true`), always exists, cannot be renamed/deleted. Nutrients with `group = nil` resolve to General at query time.
- **Group management** — Settings → Manage Groups. Create, rename, reorder, delete (moves nutrients to General).
- **Move to Group** — via context menu on nutrient rows. Half-sheet with group list and inline "New Group" option.
- Group headers hidden when only General group exists.

---

## Streaks

Daily streak tracking, opt-in via `UserPreferences.streaksEnabled` (default `true`). A streak day is a completed past day where all active non-excluded nutrients met their targets. Today is never counted. `Nutrient.createdAt` scopes each nutrient's streak window.

**UI:** `🔥 X-day streak` on Today (when ≥ 1), summary card in History, streak labels in small/medium widgets. `StreakService.compute(context:) → StreakResult` runs on foreground and after intake actions.

---

## In-App Review Prompt

Uses `SKStoreReviewController` — no custom UI. Triggered after intake actions when any condition is met: streak hits 3/7/14 days, or total intake count crosses 30. Guards: once per app version, 90-day cooldown, account age ≥ 3 days, never on cold launch. Implemented in `ReviewService`.

---

## Widgets

Four widget configurations in `NutrxWidgetsExtension`:

| Widget | Kind ID | Family | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| Small | `NutrxSmallWidget` | `.systemSmall` | Completion ring with count |
| Medium | `NutrxMediumWidget` | `.systemMedium` | 3 nutrient rows with interactive + buttons |
| Circular | `NutrxCircularWidget` | `.accessoryCircular` | Lock screen ring gauge |
| Inline | `NutrxInlineWidget` | `.accessoryInline` | Lock screen text: "3 / 6 on target" |

**Infrastructure:** App Group `group.nutrx-labs.nutrx` for shared SwiftData store. `LogNutrientIntent` (AppIntent) for interactive + buttons — target membership must include both app and widget extension. `ModelContainerFactory` shared across both targets. No `@Query` in widgets — manual `ModelContext` fetches in `TimelineProvider`. Widgets refresh on intent completion and app foreground.

---

## iCloud Sync

Automatic CloudKit sync across all Apple devices. On by default, no setup required.

**Key details:**
- Container: `iCloud.nutrx-labs.nutrx`. Falls back to local-only if CloudKit unavailable.
- Entitlements: both main app and widget extension need iCloud + CloudKit capability.
- **New-device flow:** waits up to 3 seconds for CloudKit sync, skips onboarding if `UserProfile` found.
- **Conflict resolution:** last-write-wins for most models. `IntakeRecord` is append-only, so concurrent logging from two devices produces two valid records (correct by design).
- **Local → CloudKit upgrade:** on first CloudKit launch, backs up existing store before init. If CloudKit creates an empty store, migrates all data from backup (prevents TestFlight update data loss). Tracked via `UserDefaults` key `nutrx.hasCompletedCloudKitUpgrade`.
- **Remote changes:** Today screen listens for `NSPersistentStoreRemoteChange` to auto-refresh on sync.
- **Settings:** iCloud Sync section with toggle, status display, and "Delete iCloud Data" option.
- **Banners:** one-time sync-restored and sync-enabled banners on Today screen (priority below notification banner).
- **CloudKit model rules:** all relationships optional arrays (`[T]?`), no `@Attribute(.unique)`, all scalars need property-level defaults.

---

## Monetisation

- Free with no ads. **Pro tier** planned for MVP 4 — only AI-powered features (insights, smart targets, NLP logging, full history charts).
- Indicative pricing: $2.99/month · $19.99/year · $49.99 lifetime.
- Do not build any paywall, StoreKit, or AI infrastructure before MVP 4.

---

## Out of Scope — Not Yet Built

**MVP 3 (in progress):** Analytics & charts, Apple Health integration (HealthKit write)

**MVP 4:** Pro tier (StoreKit 2), AI features (on-device + third-party LLM)

**Deferred:** Localisation, iPad-specific layout, data export

---

## Data Models

All persistence is handled via SwiftData. Seven model classes. No data is ever sent off-device.

### Design principles
- **Everything is derived from raw records** — no pre-aggregated totals. Today's intake = SUM of `IntakeRecord` rows for today's calendar day.
- **Soft deletes on Nutrient** — `isDeleted = true` hides from UI, preserves historical data.
- **SwiftData relationships use navigation properties** — no manual ID fields.
- **Do not add `@unchecked Sendable`** to `@Model` classes — the macro handles it.
- **Date comparisons must use calendar day** — not timestamp equality.
- **Decrements are negative IntakeRecords** — total is always SUM, floored at 0 in UI.
- **No explicit midnight reset** — calendar-day scoping handles this naturally.
- **Property-level defaults on @Model fields** — required for SwiftData lightweight migration.
- **CloudKit compatibility** — optional relationship arrays (`[T]?`, access via `?? []`), no `@Attribute(.unique)`, all scalars default.

---

### UserProfile

Single instance. Collected during onboarding, editable via Profile.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `String` | Free text |
| `birthdate` | `Date` | Date only |
| `weight` | `Double` | In user's chosen unit |
| `weightUnit` | `String` | `"kg"` or `"lbs"` |
| `height` | `Double` | In user's chosen unit |
| `heightUnit` | `String` | `"cm"` or `"ft"` |
| `onboardingCompleted` | `Bool` | Gate for main app access |
| `createdAt` | `Date = Date()` | Used by ReviewService for account age guard |

---

### Nutrient

User-defined nutrient to track.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `UUID = UUID()` | Used by `LogNutrientIntent` for widgets |
| `name` | `String` | e.g. "Vitamin D" |
| `unit` | `String` | e.g. "mg", "IU" |
| `step` | `Double` | Increment per +/− tap, must be > 0 |
| `dailyTarget` | `Double` | The daily goal |
| `sortOrder` | `Int` | Legacy flat sort order, tiebreaker for groupSortOrder |
| `groupSortOrder` | `Int = 0` | Order within group |
| `isDeleted` | `Bool` | Soft delete flag |
| `notes` | `String?` | Shown on Today card when non-empty |
| `group` | `NutrientGroup?` | `nil` → General group |
| `createdAt` | `Date = Date()` | Used by streak computation |

**Relationships:** → many `IntakeRecord`? (cascade), → many `Exclusion`? (cascade), → many `NutrientReminder`? (cascade), → one `NutrientGroup?` (nullify)

---

### IntakeRecord

Single logging event. Total = SUM of all records for a nutrient on a calendar day.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `nutrient` | `Nutrient` | Relationship |
| `amount` | `Double` | Can be negative (decrements) |
| `date` | `Date` | Full timestamp, use calendar-day comparison for grouping |
| `note` | `String?` | Optional, set via Add Exact Amount |

---

### UserPreferences

Single instance. App-wide settings.

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dailyReminderEnabled` | `Bool` | `false` | Daily check-in notification |
| `hasSeenNotificationBanner` | `Bool` | `false` | One-time banner suppression |
| `streaksEnabled` | `Bool` | `true` | Streak tracking toggle |
| `iCloudSyncEnabled` | `Bool` | `true` | CloudKit sync toggle |
| `hasSeenSyncRestoredBanner` | `Bool` | `false` | One-time banner |
| `hasSeenSyncEnabledBanner` | `Bool` | `false` | One-time banner |
| `lastReviewRequestedVersion` | `String?` | `nil` | Review prompt version gate |
| `lastReviewRequestedDate` | `Date?` | `nil` | Review prompt 90-day cooldown |

---

### Exclusion

Nutrient excluded from a specific day's Today view. Created by "Exclude for today", auto-cleared next day.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `nutrient` | `Nutrient` | Relationship |
| `date` | `Date` | Calendar day only |

---

### NutrientGroup

Named group for organising nutrients.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `String` | User-defined label |
| `sortOrder` | `Int` | Display order |
| `isSystem` | `Bool = false` | `true` only for General group |
| `isCollapsed` | `Bool = false` | Persisted collapsed state |

**Relationships:** → many `Nutrient`? (nullify)

---

### NutrientReminder

Scheduled dose reminder for a nutrient. Maps to one daily local notification.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `nutrient` | `Nutrient` | Relationship |
| `timeOfDay` | `Date` | Only time component used |

---

## Code & Architecture Guidelines

- Use **SwiftUI** throughout — no UIKit unless absolutely unavoidable.
- Use **SwiftData** for all persistence (user profile, nutrients, daily logs, history).
- Follow **MVVM** — keep views dumb, push logic into view models or model layer.
- Use **Swift concurrency** (async/await) — no Combine or callbacks unless SwiftData requires it.
- Keep features modular: each tab should live in its own folder/group.
- No third-party dependencies for the MVP — use only Apple frameworks.
- Prefer **SF Symbols** for all icons.
- All user-facing strings should be in English for MVP (no localisation infrastructure needed yet).
- Write code that is **readable over clever** — Claude Code will be iterating on this frequently.
